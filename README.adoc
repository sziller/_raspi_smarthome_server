****
This is the Software application of the SmartHome my Castle development.
****

[IMPORTANT]
====
Keep in mind! As the development can be used in different scopes, you may not have to deal with most of the factors we
list below. +
E.g.:

- Locally run Engine only Installations, will not need any connection settings.
- If you do not allow remote access, you can completelly avoid dealing with world-facing security, port forwarding, etc.
- If you only run the Development with one Hardware only, you wont have to deal with the Local Network. 
====

When setting up your SmartHome using the Entire feature set of the SmartHome my Castle Development, proceed as listed
below:

.... Design your smart home setup, based on building architecture, building hardware conditions, set of physical systems
you want to monitor or controll. Ideally, you should consult your Building Architect and Construction Engineer to 
incorporate relevant decisions right from the beginning of the building design process.

.... Install computer hardware, sensors, robots where they are needed, where these can work optimally. They sould be
practically accessible to you, but not necessarly to unauthorized, unwarranted or even incompetent people.
Mind necessary power supply, network connection, WiFi coverge, Provider-router access, cooling/ ventillation, etc. +
Make sure the is network connection possible between system parts on hardware level/ router level.

.... Establish IT connection between parts of the Development, and connection between development and the outside world.
Mind your DHCP, set up logical IP settings, Port system. Check necessary Port forwarding, check Internet connectivity.
Allow secure connection using HTTPS. + 
Install OS' onto RaspberryPis. Install necessary hardware mounted and controlled by Nodes.
Enable and prepare SSH connections. (needed for both local connection and GitHub repo access):
Create secure keypairs, use password protected keys.

.... Download, install and run necessary software (e.g.: Server with routers, Message Handlers, Engines) 
To to so, clone repos, setup git environments.

====
This README section of the document only deals with *_Point D_* - the software part of the Development.
It is necessary to handle the software in the context of the entire system, as highlighted here at

=== repository
Find actual project repo under:
https://github.com/sziller/_raspi_smarthome_server

=== whom and what for?
_Version: v0.0.0_ +
Modular open-source SmartHome application for self-sovereign  

=== how do I get started?
You will need to rename and update the following files:

* `temp-config.py` must be renamed to `config.py`!
* `temp-config_prv.py` must be renamed to `config_prv`!
* `.env-temp` must be renamed to `.env`

==== Summary of set up
tbd...

==== Configuration
tbd...

==== Dependencies
Not much, other than what's listed above. 
Run it on a Linux system, mind requirements, and use the `lib` directory to install additional packages.

==== Database configuration
tbd...

==== How to run tests
tbd...

==== Deployment instructions
tbd...

==== Entry Point
Use one of the following Pyhton3 scripts to run the Server:

* `APP_srv_cl` - instantiating a wrapped-class to run the server
* `APP_srv_fn` - a function based server start - more of a tutorial style code-branch

All `config.py` and `.env` contents are compatible with both Entry-Points.

=== how can you contribute?

* Writing tests
* Code review
* Comments on architecture or development decisions
* Possible refactoring ideas
