[[remote:access]]
=== access Node
[%interactive]
* [ ] establish connection to Node

==== ssh
If you want to access any of the Nodes using ssh, enter:

 ssh <username>@<ip-address>

Then you enter the *password* realted to <username>. +
In the SHMC development we stick to username = `pi` as this is the default Raspberry username.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Passwords have been changed!
For local _ssh_ login you need a different password to the one stored with _id_rsa_!
