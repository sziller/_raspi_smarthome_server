== Project introduction
=== Motivation
==== System
We want to build a modular smart-home system on fully open-source basis. I want to enable full control over ones home.
A home in this context is regarded as one *sovereign* interconnected system, where - though modular in architecture -
parts of the infrastructure can intaract with eachother, use each-others measurements, computational results.
As we deal with brick-and-mortar buildings, at the edge of this project you'll always find mostly physical systems,
such as:

- sensors
- appliances
- switches (relais)
- enegry sources

==== Control
We strive to achieve as much *decentralization* and *soverignity* as possible. The user of this project should *never*
have to rely on 3rd parties.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Decentralization is hard to achieve. The user obviously can anytime use 3rd party software if he chooses to.

=== Technology
The Project intends to be usable from step 0. Right at the moment you download the server, you should be good to go.
Then - as you're ready to invest more resources - build up a more complex system module-by-module according to your
preferences.
Thus, the entire SmrtHome my Castle Project is organized to be modular regarding both development and deployment 

Functionality modules::
We concentrate on residential buildings/ apartments. This choice more-or-less determines the functionality we target.
Here are some examles we are currently implementing:

* Room climate manager
** environmental measurements
** controlling local heating, humidity, lights, other appiances
* Observatory center at entrance
** environmental measurements
** optical measurement
** image recognition
** controlling lights, locking systems
* Food production manager
* Bitcoin wallet
**
* Central heating management
** reading measurements provided by multiple Nodes
* Solar energy generation

Hardware modules::
The project is built with *RaspberryPi* computing hardware (simply: Nodes) in mind.
We also make use of RaspberryPi related peripherals such as SenseHat, Raspberry Cameras.
When it comes to Node demand of your setup, you need to consider: Functions may occupy a Node by their own,
or may share a Node with other modules. We basically create a mesh network of
Nodes inside a building/ apartment. Nodes are placed in several different locations strategically in the
building/ apartment. +


Meaning setting up a Live Project is not only an IT decision. You need to look at your Floorplan, Energy-bills, Kids,
Lifestyle. You might actually want to consult an Architect with a technlogical touch.

Software modules::
Most of the Functions receive their own Python Package. So you can install them as you go along.
We also encourage you to contribute in the development.
Here is a grouping of Packages based on their interaction with physical systems:

- *server*: +
Central Node at the core of your System enabling you to deal with remote communication, with handling shared Databases.

- *Node managing software*: +
Basic functionality running on Nodes. Client taks, local DB or file handling. Even possible local server tasks.

- *measurement management*: +
Some Nodes are responsible to measure and to provide measured data to the system.

- *peripheral management*: +
Some Nodes control Relais, some manage LED displays

- *background Engines*: +
In case of more complex Functionality specific Engines are running locally - on dedicated Nodes.

Timing::
The system being a mesh network of uncontrolled size/ number of Nodes, is designed to be a sluggish one.
In order to be robust, redundant, safe, we prioritize these features over swiftness. We will optimize local processes
for fast action, speed however will not be a priority when it comes to communication between nodes.

The communication between Nodes may or may not happen over shared Databases, or direct socket connections.
