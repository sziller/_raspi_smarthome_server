[[start:server]]
=== start server
If you want to run the server in venv:

[%interactive]
* [ ] Switch to local virtual environment! Then...

* [ ] activate virtual environment

 source ./venv/bin/activate

* [ ] Run the server, picking one of the EntryPoints...
** ...either from a terminal, allowing reload on changes:

 uvicorn serverClass_SHMC:server --reload
 uvicorn serverFunction_SHMC:server --reload

** ...or by running one of the Python wrapper scripts:

 pyhton3 APP_srv_cl.py
 pyhton3 APP_srv_fn.py


as <app> is a sub-api mounted under <server> when starting <server>, <app> also starts.
API included here is - as of now - mosty describint <app> - the sub-api.
So to access the docs of <app> you need to add the '/app' prefix. +
(or redefine in `config.py` under _APP_PATH_)
